These include qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) about product feedback, educational needs, and unmet expectations. The raw inputs may include:

- Audio recordings  
- Transcripts

- Questionnaire metadata  

### 2. Sales Performance Data

Structured data tables from internal databases, including:

- HCP-level sales trends  
- Product-level performance  
- Call activity and rep engagement

### Example Business Question
