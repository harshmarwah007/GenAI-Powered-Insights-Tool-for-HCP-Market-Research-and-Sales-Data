##Case Study: GenAI-Powered Insights Tool for HCP Market
Research and Sales Data
Background
You’re part of the Data & AI team in a pharmaceutical company. The Commercial and Insights teams are
looking to build a solution that enables business users to ask natural language questions and receive
meaningful insights from two primary sources:
1. Market Research (MR) Surveys
These include qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) about product feedback,
educational needs, and unmet expectations. The raw inputs could be:
o Audio recordings
o Transcripts
o PDF and PowerPoint summaries
o Questionnaire metadata
2. Sales Performance Data
Structured data tables from internal databases with:
o HCP-level sales trends
o Product-level performance
o Call activity and rep engagement
The business wants to ask complex, multi-source questions like:
“What are the most common objections raised by endocrinologists whose prescription volume dropped in the
past 2 quarters?”
What is expected from you as part of the case study response?
1. Create a proposed solution design
2. Define the system architecture
3. Recommend the infrastructure and tech stack
4. Suggest how the solution can be made reusable and scalable
5. Share a project plan and resource requirements
6. Do you think model fine-tuning will be required for this solution? If yes, what would you fine-tune it
on, and how would you approach the fine-tuning process?
7. Can you outline the measures you will take to ensure the application's security, along with the key
considerations involved?
